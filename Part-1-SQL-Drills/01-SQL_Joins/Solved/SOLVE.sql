/*• PART 1
Describe the different types of join clauses supported in SQL.
There are mainly four types of joins that you need to understand. They are:
	INNER JOIN
	FULL JOIN
	LEFT JOIN
	RIGHT JOIN
You can refer to the below image.
 
INNER JOIN
This type of join returns those records which have matching values in both tables. So, if you perform an INNER join operation between the Employee table and the Projects table, all the tuples which have matching values in both the tables will be given as output.
FULL JOIN
Full Join or the Full Outer Join returns all those records which either have a match in the left(Table1) or the right(Table2) table.
LEFT JOIN
The LEFT JOIN or the LEFT OUTER JOIN  returns all the records from the left table and also those records which satisfy a condition from the right table. Also, for the records having no matching values in the right table, the output or the result-set will contain the NULL values.
RIGHT JOIN
The RIGHT JOIN or the RIGHT OUTER JOIN  returns all the records from the right table and also those records which satisfy a condition from the left table. Also, for the records having no matching values in the left table, the output or the result-set will contain the NULL values.
